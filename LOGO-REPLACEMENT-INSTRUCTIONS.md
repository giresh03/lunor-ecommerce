# Logo Replacement Instructions for lunor.ko

## Steps to Replace the Logo

To use your lunor.ko logo with the moon graphic throughout the website, you need to replace the logo.png files in two locations:

### 1. Frontend Logo
**Location:** `/Users/gireshkumar/forever/frontend/src/assets/logo.png`

**Steps:**
1. Find your lunor.ko logo image file (the one with the moon graphic)
2. Copy or save it
3. Navigate to: `forever/frontend/src/assets/`
4. Replace the existing `logo.png` file with your new logo file
5. Make sure the file is named exactly: `logo.png`

### 2. Admin Logo
**Location:** `/Users/gireshkumar/forever/admin/src/assets/logo.png`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to: `forever/admin/src/assets/`
2. Replace the existing `logo.png` file with your new logo file
3. Make sure the file is named exactly: `logo.png`

## Important Notes

- ✅ The logo components are already set up correctly
- ✅ They will automatically use the new logo.png files once replaced
- ✅ Make sure both logo files use the same image for consistency
- ✅ Preferred format: PNG with transparent background (if needed)
- ✅ Recommended size: At least 400x100px for best quality

## Where the Logo Will Appear

Once replaced, your lunor.ko logo will appear in:
- ✅ Frontend navigation bar
- ✅ Frontend footer
- ✅ Admin dashboard navigation bar
- ✅ All pages automatically using the LunorLogo component

## After Replacing

1. Save the new logo.png files in both locations
2. Refresh your development server
3. The logo should now appear throughout the website!
